### Hi! I'm Roberto Salas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a political scientist with a master in methods currently living and working in Chile. I'm a opensource enthusiast and supporter of different projects mainly related to Python and R language. I use Linux and Unix based operating systems since the year 2001 so I have a large amount experience managing workflows on the platforms. I have interest in social good so if you have a interesting project don't hesitate to contact me.
