### Hi! I'm Roberto Salas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a political scientist. I currently live and work in Chile. I'm a opensource enthusiast and make continuous contributions to different projects mainly related to  Python and R language. I use Linux and Unix based operating systems since the year 2001 so I have a large amount experience managing workflows on the platform. I have interest in social good so if you have a interesting project don't hesitate to contact me.
